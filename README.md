NOTE: Base is currently unfinished, but works as a very basic starting template for website development.

Base folder structure and files to get development started on a website.

To use:
1.  Change line 2 in package.json to appropriate name.

2.  Change line 93 to your project root directory. It should read like:
      WINDOWS: proxy: "localhost/project-name/"
      MAC: proxy: "localhost:8888/project-name/" (Or whatever you set your port number as).

3.  In your terminal:
    - cd to project folder.
    - npm install gulp
    - npm install
    - gulp
    and gulp is now set up!

4. Alter base Sass and HTML files to suit the projects needs.
5. Build your site!
